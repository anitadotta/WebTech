<h1>Project Proposal</h1>

<h3>What is your website about?</h3>

<p>
    My website will be a Marketing Portfolio that includes the projects I created throughout my years working within the Marketing industry.
</p>

<h3>What is the objective of your website?</h3>

<p>
    Many times, when applying for a Marketing job, companies request a portfolio of your past experiences within the industry. Therefore, I will be creating a website portfolio where I can record those experiences and show to companies I apply to. I expect to update the website and continue to add material after I graduate. 
</p>

<h3>Who is your target audience?</h3>

<P>
    My target audience would be companies in the marketing industry and potential employers. I plan to use this website as a marketing tool to show employers the value I can bring to thier company. 
</P>

<h3>What content do you plan to include in each page of your website?</h3>

<p>
I plan to have a page in which I talk about who I am as a person; a page for my experiences within marketing; a page with links for each project I have created; and a page for my photography work.
